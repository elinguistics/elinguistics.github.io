This is the website of the eLinguistics foundation. The eLinguistics Foundation is an organization whose aim is to encourage the construction of infrastructure for the discipline of linguistics, and to provide financial aid to such efforts. <br/>We are accepting applications for fieldwork support. They should contain: 1. An overview including where and when the fieldwork will take place on which language(s) and topics / goals and 2. A detailed budget and justification. The eLinguistics foundation board will then review and approve or reject each request. Applications should be sent to treasurer@linguistlist.org by July 10, 2024.
